    "content": "I don't often post but I do have something to boast about this week and thought this was a good place to share! I asked for a pay rise and I got it!! A little story breakdown for you: \nA few weeks ago, I had a conversation with my boss about a colleague who was talking about other team members behind their backs. I believe she has a good heart, but something about this company makes her behaviour a bit toxic. So I (for once) stood up and said something. My boss said she would take the feedback on board. \nTwo days later, that colleague was sent to a different department. My workload increased with ALMOST ALL OF HER ASSIGNED WORK. I'd been taking on bits for a while, but this was an avalanche. \nI coped for 10 days but then almost had to take time off because of stress. I decided this was enough. I was nervous about talking to my boss again and seeming like a whinge, but she'd been receptive before, and trusted me because other people had called the above colleague out as well. So I told her I was swamped. I was taking on too much already and it had only increased with the transfer. I said I'd have to spread it over a longer timeline, and then in a stroke of madness, I said I could keeping going with part of the extra workload for higher pay!! \nI HAVE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE. \nBut I was feeling inspired by you guys. \nShe said she would think about it, and then the next day asked for a number! So I gave her my number and (after a little bit of back-and-forth), she accepted. \nI used all the techniques you've mentioned, like using my brag document and thinking of the number beforehand, and it worked. IT ACTUALLY WORKED. \nI'm gonna take my career into my own hands more often now. Shoutout to all of you guys for being an inspiration this past year. Good luck in your own negotiations!",

I've always been a saver, but we've just used almost all of my savings towards a deposit on our house, and this inspired me to ask if she could save a bit too.

She's a very loving and easily excitable person, but this often translates into little gifts everywhere, buying rounds of drinks and splurging on herself because 'she's worth it' (which I do fully believe). I don't want to be harsh so we need to have a healthy conversation about savings! Anyone have any advice or experience here?",
