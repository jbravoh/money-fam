## Motivation

### The problem

Brits are bad at talking money. Shame, upbringing and burdening others means 29 million UK adults don't feel comfortable talking about finances, despite feeling worried about them.

### The solution

MoneyFam is an online community where members share their concerns anonymously. They can give each other tips and support, and receive advice from respected community members, particularly those who are MoneyFam certified (fiduciaries only, subject to financial regulations).

### The journey

When users sign up, they enter a dialogue about their finances. They are asked about their situation in a non-judgemental manner and offered suggestions on how to move to the next level. They are directed to a 'topic' where other community members are discussing these suggestions, so that they feel included and supported, no matter the state of their bank account.

As users progress, they can go through the dialogue again and advance to the next level. In the meantime, they are free to browse all topics, to see what people are discussing all over the country.

Financial suggestions are based on the [UK Personal Finance Flowchart](https://ukpersonal.finance/flowchart/).

### The future...

MoneyFam is a scalable solution to the UK's money taboo. There are many ways to expand its reach and impact, here are just a few:
- Get financial advisers on board (specifically fiduciaries, so that we maintain positive incentives all-round) for a revenue stream from referrals
- Replace the flowchart chatbot with a transformer-based NLP model, that can analyse natural language responses to identify a user's level
- Expand to other countries by replacing the static chatbot content with region-specific suggestions
